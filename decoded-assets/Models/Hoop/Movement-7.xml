<!-- This is a movement settings file for the "Chainsaw" model, movement type is "left diagonal":
		- Rules:
			-- ?X? : Replaces the order number
			
	
		- Type: Indicates the movement type
			-- value: The type
				--- Static: The object doesn't move (used for rotation movement)
				--- Linear: The object moves between points in a linear way
				--- Circular: The object moves between points in a circular way
	
		- Path: Configures the movement path
			-- points: Number of points to alternate between
			-- repeat: Whether or not we should repeat the movement after its ended
		
		- Point?X?: Indicates the point parameters (points order starts at 1)
			-- x: The x position
				--- None: The x axis remains its previous position
				--- Left: Will be positioned "distance/2" meters left from its last position
				--- Right: Will be positioned "distance/2" meters right from its last position
				
			-- y: The y position
				--- None: The y axis remains at its previous position
				--- Middle: Will be positioned at the centre of the screen
				--- Up: Will be positioned "distance/2" meters above its center position
				--- Down: Will be positioned "distance/2" meters below its center position
		
	
		- Rotation: Configures the rotation movement
			-- speed: The rotation speed
