# Introduction

After finishing my first game (<a href="https://github.com/MedAnisBenSalah/Slicky-Futon">Slicky Futon</a>), horribly failing on the marketing side, and because my marketing budget was basically non-existent, 
i decided that i needed to come up with better idea to drive in more downloads, so i started cloning popular games, around late 2017, Voodoo's Flappy Dunk
was the hottest game around, picking up on that, i took Slicky Futon's base and in two weeks i transformed it into this game.

It drove in more than 25 000 downloads in a couple of months and started appearing second in search results after the original game, then as with every game of mine, 
it was removed from the store along with my developer's suspended account.
